# Registration Form

A simple client-side registration form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates form structure, validation, and basic UX for collecting user information.

Features
- Client-side validation for required fields, email format, and password confirmation.
- Accessible and responsive layout using semantic HTML and CSS.
- Lightweight vanilla JavaScript with clear separation of concerns (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`).

Getting Started
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the form.
2. Fill in the fields and submit — validation runs in the browser and shows inline messages.

Project Structure
- `index.html`: Form markup and structure.
- `style.css`: Styling and responsive rules.
- `script.js`: Validation logic and form handling.
- `README.md`: Project overview and usage instructions.

Customization
- Add or remove fields in `index.html` and update validation rules in `script.js`.
- Replace colors and typography in `style.css` to match your brand.

Notes
- This project performs client-side validation only. For production use, always validate and sanitize data on the server as well.
- No external dependencies — easy to drop into an existing website or use as a learning example.
